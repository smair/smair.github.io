### about me

I am an assistant professor at the [Division of Statistics and Machine Learning](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ida/stima) at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en), Sweden. In 2026, I obtained my docent qualification (Swedish Habilitation) at Linköping University. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Division of Systems and Control](https://www.uu.se/en/department/information-technology) at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), where I was a member of the research group of [Jens Sjölund](https://jsjol.github.io/).
I did my PhD at the [machine learning group](http://ml3.leuphana.de/team.html) of [Ulf Brefeld](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oWmjswoAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Leuphana University of Lüneburg](http://www.leuphana.de/en/). Prior to that, I received a Master of Science in computer science as well as a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) and a Bachelor of Science in computer science from [Hochschule Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences](https://h-da.de/en/).

I work on *data-efficient machine learning*: how to train, optimise, and deploy models using less data and less compute without giving up performance or reliability. A recurrent theme in my work is *representative subset selection* (coresets and related data summarisation ideas), methods that identify the most informative training examples or optimisation variables so that learning and decision-making become faster, cheaper, and more sustainable. I develop algorithms with statistical and geometric grounding, and I evaluate them in methodological settings (e.g., unsupervised/representation learning and probabilistic modelling) as well as in applied pipelines where computational budgets matter. Increasingly, I am interested in how data reduction can serve as a practical lever for **sustainable ML**: reducing storage, training time, and energy use, while making the modelling process easier to audit and iterate on.

### research interests

I am interested in unsupervised learning, representation learning, representative subsets, (geometric) data summarisation, generative modelling, probabilistic modelling, statistical machine learning, and the sustainability of machine learning.
