### about me

I am a PhD student at the [machine learning group](http://ml3.leuphana.de/team.html) of [Ulf Brefeld](http://ml3.leuphana.de/ulf.html) at the [Leuphana University of Lüneburg](http://www.leuphana.de/en/home.html).

Prior to my PhD studies, I received a Master of Science in computer science as well as a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from [Technische Universität Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) and a Bachelor of Science in computer science from [Hochschule Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences](https://h-da.de/en/).


### research interests

I am interested in unsupervised learning, representation learning, representative subsets, (geometric) data summarization, generative modeling, probabilistic modeling, and statistical machine learning.
