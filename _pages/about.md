### about me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Information Technology](https://www.it.uu.se/), [Division of Systems and Control](http://www.it.uu.se/research/systems_and_control) at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), where he is a member of the research group of [Jens Sjölund](https://jsjol.github.io/). My position is funded by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/).

Prior to joining Uppsala University, I was a PhD student at the [machine learning group](http://ml3.leuphana.de/team.html) of [Ulf Brefeld](http://ml3.leuphana.de/ulf.html) at the [Leuphana University of Lüneburg](http://www.leuphana.de/en/home.html).

Furthermore, I received a Master of Science in computer science as well as a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from [Technische Universität Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) and a Bachelor of Science in computer science from [Hochschule Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences](https://h-da.de/en/).


### research interests

I am interested in unsupervised learning, representation learning, representative subsets, (geometric) data summarization, generative modeling, probabilistic modeling, and statistical machine learning.
